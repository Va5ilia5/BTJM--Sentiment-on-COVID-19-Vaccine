## Goal of Analysis
We'll use the following notebook to do sentiment analysis on a set of tweets concerning the Covid-19 vaccination:

* Pfizer/BioNTech
* Sinopharm
* Sinovac
* Moderna
* Oxford/AstraZeneca
* Covaxin
* Sputnik V.


The tweets are then tagged as either positive (i.e. vaccine is safe!) or negative (i.e. don't get the vaccination) We'll wrap off this article by looking at the terms that are most indicative of a positive or negative tweet.
